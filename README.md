# DReal_Estate
This is a Web5 project on DMEEKRON DREAL ESTATE 
Having Contributors, Oluwatimileyin, Samson, and John

The aim of this project is to build a Web5 solution for Real Estate in Nigeraia 

To develop a decentralized identity system for properties, we can use Web5’s DIDs to create unique identifiers for each property.
This will ensure that the data associated with each property is accurate and cannot be tampered with.
we can also use Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to verify the authenticity of the data associated with each property 

Web5’s Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) can be used to store the data associated with each property. 
DWNs are personal data stores that hold public and encrypted data. Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs) can be used to access the data stored in DWNs.
